# handwritten-character-recognition

This project is designed to recognize handwritten characters using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits and letters. The goal is to create a model that can accurately recognize these characters and classify them into the correct category.  

## Getting Started  
To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:  

Tensorflow
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Once you have the required libraries installed, you can start training the model. To do this, run the train.py script. This will train the model on the MNIST dataset and save the model to disk.  
  
To test the model, run the test.py script. This script will load the trained model and test it on a set of test images. The results will be displayed on the console.  

## Acknowledgments
This project was made possible by the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used dataset in the machine learning community. The code for this project was inspired by various online tutorials and resources. Special thanks to the developers of the libraries used in this project.
